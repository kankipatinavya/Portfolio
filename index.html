    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Navya Sri, a recent Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) graduate with a strong interest in software development, cloud computing, and IT support. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed practical skills in Java, C, HTML, DBMS, and cloud platforms like AWS.

I’ve built projects such as AWS S3-based file management systems and automated file transfer setups using FileZilla, which helped me gain hands-on experience with cloud architecture and secure data transmission.

I’ve also completed certifications from Oracle Academy and Cisco in areas like Java programming, cybersecurity, and data science. I’m now looking for entry-level opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, grow as a developer, and contribute meaningfully to a dynamic team.</p>
